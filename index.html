            <hr>

            <p>
                Unstable angina is a critical phase of coronary heart disease with widely variable symptoms and
                prognosis. A decade ago, a classification of unstable angina based on clinical symptoms was introduced.
                This system was then validated by prospective clinical studies to correlate with the prognosis and was
                linked to angiographic and histological findings. It has been used to categorize patients in many large
                clinical trials. In recent years, the pathophysiological roles of platelet activation and inflammation
                in unstable angina have been elucidated. Subsequently, improved markers of myocardial injury,
                acute-phase proteins, and hemostatic markers that may be associated with clinical outcomes have been
                identified. Particularly, cardiac-specific troponin T and troponin I have been shown to represent the
                best predictors of early risk in patients with angina at rest. Accordingly, it is suggested that the
                original classification be extended by subclassifying one large group of unstable angina patients, ie,
                those with angina at rest within the past 48 hours (class IIIB), into troponin-positive (Tpos) and
                troponin-negative (Tneg) patients. The 30-days risk for death and myocardial infarction is considered to
                be up to 20% in class IIIB-Tpos but 2% in class IIIB-Tneg patients. Initial results suggest that
                troponins may function as surrogate markers for thrombus formation and can effectively guide therapy
                with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists or low-molecular-weight heparins. These observations provide
                additional impetus for adding the measurement of these markers to the clinical classification and
                represent a novel concept of treating these high-risk patients.<a

            <h3 class="disease" id="d3">Arteriosclerosis</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Context.—Arteriosclerosis is the vascular disease that is the leading cause of mortality in
                industrialized countries. Currently, there are 3 lesions within the broader category of
                arteriosclerosis: atherosclerosis, Mönckeberg medial calcific sclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis.

                Objective.—In this review, we discuss the history of the terminology and current classification of
                arteriosclerosis and problems with the current classification. We also discuss recently described new
                arterial lesions that are not in the current classification.

                Data Sources.—In spite of the prevalence and importance of arteriosclerotic vascular disease, and the
                widespread use of the current terminology, there are major problems with the current classification: (1)
                the current classification has an inconsistent naming convention, (2) the classification fails to use
                terms that accurately describe the lesions, and (3) important arterial lesions are absent from the
                classification. In addition, although the terms arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis describe different
                lesions, these terms are often used interchangeably.

                Conclusion.—Consideration should be given for a new more inclusive and accurate classification of
                “arteriosclerotic” lesions that more accurately reflects the pathology of these important vascular
                lesions.

                Arteriosclerosis is literally the hardening of an artery. Standard textbooks of pathology and numerous
                other resources consistently list 3 lesions under the term arteriosclerosis: (1) atherosclerosis, (2)
                Mönckeberg medial calcific sclerosis, and (3) arteriolosclerosis.1–3 These lesions generally share 3
                features: (1) they result in stiffening of arterial vessels; (2) they cause thickening of the arterial
                wall; and (3) in the past, they have been considered “degenerative” diseases. Herein we review the
                history of arteriosclerosis nomenclature, the current classification of arteriosclerosis, and the
                shortcomings of this classification. Finally, we review the subtypes of arteriosclerosis with emphasis
                on how future classification could more accurately and comprehensively categorize these lesions. This
                discussion includes examples of lesions that could qualify as arteriosclerosis yet are not currently
                classified as such. We exclude consideration of vasculitides, malformations, vascular dysplasia,
                connective tissue disorders, and neoplasms involving arterial vessels; the nomenclature of these lesions
                is already sufficiently complex and confusing. <a

            <h3 class="disease" id="d4">Eating disorders</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Eating disorders are serious health conditions that affect both your physical and mental health. These
                conditions include problems in how you think about food, eating, weight and shape, and in your eating
                behaviors. Reviewed here are data on the consequences and costs of eating disorders. All three of the
                eating disorders, anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder are associated
                with high levels of comorbid psychopathology, and AN has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric
                disorder. These consequences are reflected in the high costs associated with treatment of these
                disorders. AN is as costly to treat as schizophrenia, whereas BN and binge-eating disorder are as costly
                to treat as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The relative costs of cognitive-behavioral therapy
                (CBT) and antidepressant medication for BN are outlined, as are potential methods to reduce treatment
                costs.

                Although BN was first described only 20 years ago,22 it is now considered, together with AN, as a severe
                mental illness. The California legislature, recognizing the burden borne by patients with eating
                disorders, listed AN and BN among the nine diagnoses, including schizophrenia, bipolar personality
                disorder, and OCD, that were to be given parity for health care with severe medical conditions by health
                maintenance organizations and third-party payers. Now, the outlines of the consequences and costs of AN
                and BN for patients, their families, and society are becoming apparent. Although fewer data are
                available for the newly designated diagnosis of binge-eating disorder, a condition that, according to
                the DSM-IV, requires further research, at least some of the costs are apparent.<a

            <h3 class="disease" id="d2">Parkinson</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Parkinson disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2–3% of the
                population ≥65 years of age. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, which causes striatal dopamine
                deficiency, and intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of α-synuclein are the neuropathological
                hallmarks of Parkinson disease. Multiple other cell types throughout the central and peripheral
                autonomic nervous system are also involved, probably from early disease onwards. Although clinical
                diagnosis relies on the presence of bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, Parkinson disease is
                associated with many non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. The underlying molecular
                pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms: α-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial
                function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport and neuroinflammation. Recent research
                into diagnostic biomarkers has taken advantage of neuroimaging in which several modalities, including
                PET, single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and novel MRI techniques, have been shown to aid early and
                differential diagnosis. Treatment of Parkinson disease is anchored on pharmacological substitution of
                striatal dopamine, in addition to non-dopaminergic approaches to address both motor and non-motor
                symptoms and deep brain stimulation for those developing intractable L-DOPA-related motor complications.
                Experimental therapies have tried to restore striatal dopamine by gene-based and cell-based approaches,
                and most recently, aggregation and cellular transport of α-synuclein have become therapeutic targets.
                One of the greatest current challenges is to identify markers for prodromal disease stages, which would
                allow novel disease-modifying therapies to be started earlier. <a

            <h3 class="disease" id="d5">Hypertension</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and
                premature death worldwide. Owing to the widespread use of antihypertensive medications, global mean
                blood pressure (BP) has remained constant or has decreased slightly over the past four decades. By
                contrast, the prevalence of hypertension has increased, especially in low- and middle-income countries
                (LMICs). Estimates suggest that 31.1% of adults (1.39 billion) worldwide had hypertension in 2010. The
                prevalence of hypertension among adults was higher in LMICs (31.5%, 1.04 billion people) than in
                high-income countries (28.5%, 349 million people). Variations in the levels of risk factors for
                hypertension, such as high sodium intake, low potassium intake, obesity, alcohol consumption, physical
                inactivity and unhealthy diet, may explain some of the regional heterogeneity in hypertension
                prevalence. Despite the increasing prevalence, the proportions of hypertension awareness, treatment and
                BP control are low, particularly in LMICs, and few comprehensive assessments of the economic impact of
                hypertension exist. Future studies are warranted to test implementation strategies for hypertension
                prevention and control, especially in low-income populations, and to accurately assess the prevalence
                and financial burden of hypertension worldwide. <a

            <h3 class="disease" id="d6">Shock</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> Shock is a critical condition brought on by the sudden drop in blood flow through
                the body. Shock may result from trauma, heatstroke, blood loss or an allergic reaction. It also may
                result from severe infection, poisoning, severe burns or other causes.There are only four major
                categories of shock, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. Hypovolemic shock
                relates to the blood and fluids compartment while distributive shock relates to the vascular system;
                cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac dysfunction; and obstructive shock arises from a blockage
                of the circulation. Hypovolemic shock is due to intravascular volume loss and is treated by fluid
                replacement with balanced crystalloids. Distributive shock, on the other hand, is a state of relative
                hypovolemia resulting from pathological redistribution of the absolute intravascular volume and is
                treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock is due to
                inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs,
                surgery, or other interventional procedures. In obstructive shock, hypoperfusion due to elevated
                resistance shall be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention. <a

            <h3 class="disease" id="d7">Myocardial infarction (MI)</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Myocardial infarction (MI), colloquially known as "heart attack," is caused by decreased or complete
                cessation of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium. Myocardial infarction may be"silent," and go
                undetected, or it could be a catastrophic event leading to hemodynamic deterioration and sudden
                death.Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Coronary atherosclerosis
                is a chronic disease with stable and unstable periods. During unstable periods with activated
                inflammation in the vascular wall, patients may develop a myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction
                may be a minor event in a lifelong chronic disease, it may even go undetected, but it may also be a
                major catastrophic event leading to sudden death or severe hemodynamic deterioration. A myocardial
                infarction may be the first manifestation of coronary artery disease, or it may occur, repeatedly, in
                patients with established disease. Information on myocardial infarction attack rates can provide useful
                data regarding the burden of coronary artery disease within and across populations, especially if
                standardized data are collected in a manner that demonstrates the distinction between incident and
                recurrent events. From the epidemiological point of view, the incidence of myocardial infarction in a
                population can be used as a proxy for the prevalence of coronary artery disease in that population.
                Furthermore, the term myocardial infarction has major psychological and legal implications for the
                individual and society. It is an indicator of one of the leading health problems in the world, and it is
                an outcome measure in clinical trials and observational studies. With these perspectives, myocardial
                infarction may be defined from a number of different clinical, electrocardiographic, biochemical,
                imaging, and pathological characteristics. <a

            <hr>
            <p>Leukemia is a broad term for cancers of the blood cells. The type of leukemia depends on the type of
                blood cell that becomes cancer and whether it grows quickly or slowly. Leukemia occurs most often in
                adults older than 55, but it is also the most common cancer in children younger than 15.Hypertension is
                the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. Owing to the widespread use
                of antihypertensive medications, global mean blood pressure (BP) has remained constant or has decreased

            <h3 class="disease" id="d9">Asthma</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Asthma is a chronic (long-term) condition that affects the airways in the lungs. The airways are tubes
                that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the airways can become inflamed and
                narrowed at times. This makes it harder for air to flow out of your airways when you breathe out.While
                asthma is considered an inflammatory disorder of the conducting airways, it is becoming increasingly
                apparent that the disease is heterogeneous with respect to immunopathology, clinical phenotypes,
                response to therapies, and natural history. Once considered purely an allergic disorder dominated by
                Th2-type lymphocytes, IgE, mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and cytokines, the disease also
                involves local epithelial, mesenchymal, vascular and neurologic events that are involved in directing
                the Th2 phenotype to the lung and through aberrant injury-repair mechanisms to remodeling of the airway
                wall. Structural cells provide the necessary “soil” upon which the “seeds” of the inflammatory response
                are able to take root and maintain a chronic phenotype and upon which are superimposed acute and
                subacute episodes usually driven by environmental factors such as exposure to allergens, microorganisms,
                pollutants or caused by inadequate antiinflammatory treatment. Greater consideration of additional
                immunologic and inflammatory pathways are revealing new ways of intervening in the prevention and
                treatment of the disease. Thus increased focus on environmental factors beyond allergic exposure (such

            <h3 class="disease" id="d10">post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a
                shocking, scary, or dangerous event. It is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic
                situation. Fear is a part of the body's “fight-or-flight” response, which helps us avoid or respond to
                potential dange.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating anxiety disorder resulting from
                trauma exposure. The stressor is a necessary but not a sufficient etiologic factor. Symptomatology in
                the aftermath of trauma should include trauma re-experience, emotional numbing or avoidance, and
                exaggerated arousal (1). A number of studies have investigated PTSD in individuals exposed to traumatic
                events. For example, combat, rape, natural disasters, serious motor vehicle accidents and crime
                experiences seem to have a strong relation to the subsequent development of PTSD (2–27). Studies in the
                general population, particularly studies with randomly selected subjects, are relatively scarce, with
                only half a dozen published, the majority reporting prevalence rates in the United States. Helzer et al.
                (28) and Davidson et al. (29), both using DSM-III (30) criteria and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule
                (DIS) (31) to assess PTSD, reported lifetime rates of 1.0 and 1.3%, respectively. The DIS has been
                criticized because the traumatic event and PTSD are not independently assessed but instead the events
                that induce the symptoms of PTSD are required to be subjectively perceived as being related to the
                traumatic event that predated the symptoms. Leaving that requirement and estimating signs and symptoms
                of PTSD irrespective of traumatic events, Resnick et al. (32) reported a lifetime DSM III-R (33) defined
                prevalence rate of 12.3% in women and Kessler et al. (34) found a prevalence rate of 10.4% in women and
                5.0% in men. The average rate of 7.8% in the Kessler et al. (34) study is similar to the figure reported
                by Breslau et al. (35), who observed an average lifetime prevalence of 8.3% (the two latter studies used
                DSM-IV criteria).<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2004.00463.x"
